 From Kaggle open resource, we had training dataset, public test dataset (which is then used as validation dataset for our project), and further a private dataset (same size with public test dataset and will be used as data for evaluating the prediction performance). It is noteworthy that in original provided dataset (either in training dataset or in public test dataset), we have actually in total 7 categories, apart from "Angry, Surprise, Fear, Happy, Sad and Neutral" that has been presented in our slides, we had an additional tag of "Disgust". However, the main problem will be that we have a quite unbalanced distribution of Disgust label in provided data, it accounts for a unusually low percentage, the obvious unbalance in data distribution will influence further neural network training, therefore we re-classify all pictures with "Disgust" label into "Angry" label. Such re-classification is relatively subjective, completely based on our perception of those two labels. Both of our teammates believe that the muscle movements in Angry face looks highly similar to that for Disgust faces.
